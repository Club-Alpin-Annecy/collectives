 # Windows
 PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
 ```

2. Clone this git repository (or unzip release archive)

3. From the root of the cloned repo, run `uv sync`

4. Start the local server: `uv run run.py`

5. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to test the app

## Configuration
Instance specific configuration can be included in `instance/config.py`

4. Run the development server (it will be available at http://localhost:5000)
    `./run.py`
    (do not run this in production)

# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork to your local machine

2. (Optional) Install `ruff` VS Code extension to format and lint your code automatically

2. Updates the dependencies lock file `uv lock`

3. Make the desired changes, following guidelines in [CODING.md]

4. Make sure your is correctly formatted: `uvx ruff format`

5. Run the linter: `uvx ruff check --fix`

6. Run unit and integration tests: `uv run pytest`

7. Push your local branch to your fork and create a pull request against the main repository

## Adding, updating dependencies

Dependency are configured the the `pyproject.toml` file, but it is recommend to use the `uv` high-level interface when possible. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/, `uv add --help` and `uv lock --help` for more information.

 - Adding a dependency `uv add your-python-package`
 - Updating the depency lock file: `uv lock`. This may be necessary if changing the `pyproject.toml` file directly.
 - Upgrading all dependencies to latest possible version: `uv lock --upgrade`. This should be run regularly stay up to date with upstream packages.
 - A pip `requirements.txt` file may be created using `uv pip freeze`

## Building the documentation

1. Navigate to `doc` repository
2. Run `uv run make html`
3. Open the result in a web browser, e.g: `open build/html/index.html`
