""" Module to create flask client from existing fixture users.

Connection to the application does not use http but a special client available
from the app object. See flask
`documentation
<https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/testing/#sending-requests-with-the-test-client>`_.

This client is used to test GET and POST requests. Base client fixture is
:meth:`client`

For some requests, login is required. Thus, some basic fixtures are offered regarding
the client role that will be tested. EG: :meth:`admin_client` or :meth:`user1_client`.
Those client are based on :meth:`client`.

.. warning::
    Please note that Flask app offer ONLY ONE CLIENT. Thus, if you need to switch between
    roles in the same test, please use only one client fixture and change user using
    :meth:`login`
