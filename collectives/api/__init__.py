"""API of ``collectives`` website.

This is a very simple API meant to be used with Ajax frontend, mainly
`Tabulator <http://tabulator.info/>`_ . It offers ``GET`` endpoint to
serve various tables dynamically.

But it could be extended to ``POST`` and ``DELETE`` request later.
This module is initialized by the application factory, and contains the
``/api`` blueprint.
