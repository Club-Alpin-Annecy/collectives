How To
=============
This document is meant to help new comers to the project to handle it

I want to suggest a modification
------------------------------------
Please submit a Pull Request on our project on `github <https://github.com/Club-Alpin-Annecy/collectives>`_ .

We are using standard github PR process. This
`link <https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github>`_
will help you to follow it.

Please READ the CODING file before creating the PR.
In particular:

#. Format Python files using `black`. `black` is available as a formatter in some IDEs, or can be run manually from the repo root as ``python -m black *.py collectives``
#. Check Python files for errors using `pylint`, ``find collectives -name "*.py" -exec python -m pylint {} \+``
#. Make sure you are documenting your classes, methods and functions.

I want to install it on my computer to develop it
------------------------------------------------------
Regular method with VS Code
............................
For Windows, Linux and probably Mac:

#. Please install `git` and `python3` and `VS Code`.
#. Create an empty folder somewhere on your computer. The folder will be the workspace.
#. Open VSCode. 
#. In Extension (Ctrl+Shift+X), install `Python` module. Other recommended modules are `SQLite`.
#. Click on  `Clone git repository`. Select `Clone from github`. Sign into Github. 
#. Clone "Club-Alpin-Annecy/collectives" or your personnal fork.
#. When asked, open the cloned repository
#. Open terminal (Ctrl+shift+Ã¹)
#. Execute `pip install virtualenv` (Virtualenv is highly recommended)
#. Create a virtual in `.env`: `virtualenv .env`
#. If VSCode notice the new environment (bottom right popup), select Yes
#. Activate it: `. .env/Scripts/activate` for Windows, `. .env/bin/activate` for Linux.
#. Install required pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt; pip install -r requirements-tools.txt`.
#. Run ``FLASK_APP="collectives:create_app" flask db upgrade`` to populate the local database.
#. Start debugging (F5)
#. On MacOS, the port 5000 is already used by Apple Airplay Receiver. Deactivate it in your parameters (Airport & Handoff tab).
#. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000 <http://localhost:5000>`_

I want to generate the documentation
--------------------------------------
Install pip ``Sphinx``
Then,
For windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    ./make_html.bat

For Linux and Mac:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    make html

I want to file a bug
---------------------
Bugs can be opened on the github issue system: 
`https://github.com/Club-Alpin-Annecy/collectives/issues <https://github.com/Club-Alpin-Annecy/collectives/issues>`_

Fixes are very welcomed since we cannot treat bugs very quickly.

I want to talk with the developper team

The CAF Annecy has a Slack where collectives development is discussed.
